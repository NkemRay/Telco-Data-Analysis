# Telecommunication  customer Churn and Retention Analysis

## Introduction / Data sourcing
In this data analysis project, we will explore a telecommunications dataset from Kaggle to understand customer churn. 
Our goal is to determine the number of customers who have left, identify possible reasons for their departure, and make recommendations to reduce churn.

## Problem statement
 Analyze customer churn data and predict which customers are likely to leave. Use the Telco Customer Churn dataset from Kaggle

## Data pre-process(python: Pandas, Numpy)

1;	Steps taken to clean and prepare the data for analysis

 +  Imported the data into jupyter note book and made use of python libraries such as pandas and numpy for the cleaning Analysis
 +  Converted the data into Dataframe.
 +  Checked for null values and Duplicates
 +  Checked for outliers
 +  Checked and corrected inconsistensies of some data types
 

###	Challenges or limitations encountered during this phase
+ Because it still a practice process on python, i made some mistakes that took me time to figure out and correct.

## Exploratory Analysis( python: Matplotlib, seaborn)

### Methods use to explore the data, including visualizations and statistical analysis

  I made use of matplotlib and seaborn for the visualization and statistical Analysis 
 
### Below are some of the questions answered using python to gain more insight
 
 •	General Percentage of churn by variables
 
•	Create bins for the tenure in years to analyze customer loyalty

•	Delete the columns not important for processing

•	Create a bar chart for each category showing churn rate

•	Checked for the monthly charges effect on the rate of churning

•	Correlation of all variables and Churn

•	Converted all the categorical variables into dummy variables for the purpose further analysis like predictions. 
These prediction will help to determine the variable that can affects customers churning in the future  and recommend possible strategies to curb the problem

## Visualization (Excel)

Made use of Excel to create visuals.

## Conclusion
