## Introduction / Data sourcing

In this data analysis project, we will explore a telecommunications dataset from Kaggle to understand customer churn. 
Our goal is to determine the number of customers who have left, identify possible reasons for their departure, and make recommendations to reduce churn.

## Problem statement
 Analyze customer churn data and predict which customers are likely to leave. 

## Data pre-process(python: Pandas, Numpy)

1;	Steps taken to clean and prepare the data for analysis

 +  Imported the data into jupyter note book and made use of python libraries such as pandas and numpy for the cleaning Analysis
 +  Converted the data into Dataframe.
 +  Checked for null values and Duplicates
 +  Checked for outliers
 +  Checked and corrected inconsistensies of some data types
 

###	Challenges or limitations encountered during this phase
+ Because it still a practice process on python, i made some mistakes that took me time to figure out and correct.

## Exploratory Analysis( python: Matplotlib, seaborn)

### Methods use to explore the data, including visualizations and statistical analysis

  I made use of matplotlib and seaborn for the visualization and statistical Analysis 
 
### Below are some of the questions answered using python to gain more insight
 
 •	General Percentage of churn by variables
 
•	Create bins for the tenure in years to analyze customer loyalty

•	Delete the columns not important for processing

•	Create a bar chart for each category showing churn rate

•	Checked for the monthly charges effect on the rate of churning

•	Correlation of all variables and Churn

•	Converted all the categorical variables into dummy variables for the purpose of further analysis like predictive Analysis. 
These prediction will help to determine the variable that can affects customers churning in the future  and recommend possible strategies to curb the problem

## Visualization (Excel)

Made use of Power BI to create the visuals.

## Conclusion

Here are some of the insights gotten from the data

### Insight
+ 	The ratio of the churned to non churned customers is imbalance with the value as 27%:73% respectively
+  High churners as seen in case of month to month contract, tenure group from 1-12 months, no technical support and no online security.
+	 Low Churners as seen in case of long term contracts, Subscriptions without internet service.
+	 Factors like Gender, phone service and multiple lines have almost no impact on churning rate.

## Recommendation

+ Improve customer service: One of the primary reasons customers leave a service is due to poor customer service or technical support as discovered from the data. Improving Technical support can involve providing better support and being more responsive to customer needs.

+ Offer incentives: Providing incentives, such as discounts, rewards, or free services, can encourage customers to stay with the service especially for the customers that are on month to month contract. These incentives could also be targeted to be offered as a general promotion.

+ Personalize the customer experience: Personalizing the customer experience can help build loyalty and prevent churn. This can involve tailoring services to customer needs and preferences. These services could be providing subscription plans that are affordable by Targeted customers

+ Monitor customer satisfaction: Monitoring customer satisfaction levels can help identify potential churn before it happens. Regular surveys and feedback requests can help identify areas where the service can be improved and help identify customers who may be considering leaving.

+ Implement retention strategies: Retention strategies are designed to keep customers from leaving. These can include targeted promotions, upselling and cross-selling, and other strategies aimed at retaining customers.

+ Improve network performance: Poor network performance is a common reason why customers leave a service. Improving network performance can involve investing in better infrastructure, providing better coverage, and improving network speeds.
